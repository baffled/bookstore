Elizabeth is|usually imagined as the icy, untouchable|figure memorably recreated on screen by|Bette Davis and Judi Dench, but that|vision of Elizabeth ignores the|turbulent years of her early life, from|her birth as the daughter of Henry VIII|and Anne Boleyn in 1533, until her|accession to the throne in 1558|following the death of her sister Mary.|It is these early years which are the|subject of David Starkey's fascinating|Elizabeth I, written to accompany his|television series about the life of|Elizabeth. |Starkey argues that in her|first 25 years Elizabeth "had|experienced every vicissitude of fortune|and ever extreme of condition. She had|been Princess and inheritrix of England,|and bastard and disinherited; the|nominated successor to the throne and an|accused traitor on the verge of|execution; showered with lands and|houses and a prisoner in the Tower". He|draws on his skills as a respected Tudor|historian to produce a deft account of|the religious, political and dynastic|maelstrom of mid-16th century England|that reads "like a historical thriller".|The book carefully picks its way through|the finer points of contemporary|religious conflict and the peculiarities|of Tudor court ceremony, whilst also|exploring the formation of Elizabeth's|character in relation to a murdered|mother, a charismatic father, a tortured|sister, and a predatory guardian. Highly|readable and written with verve and|pace, this is a fascinating account of|the young Elizabeth. --Jerry Brotton

England, the 1520s. Henry VIII is on the throne, but has no heir. Cardinal Wolsey is his chief advisor, charged with securing the divorce the pope refuses to grant. Into this atmosphere of distrust and need comes Thomas Cromwell, first as Wolsey's clerk, and later his successor. Cromwell is a wholly original man: the son of a brutal blacksmith, a political genius, a briber, a charmer, a bully, a man with a delicate and deadly expertise in manipulating people and events. Ruthless in pursuit of his own interests, he is as ambitious in his wider politics as he is for himself. His reforming agenda is carried out in the grip of a self-interested parliament and a king who fluctuates between romantic passions and murderous rages. From one of our finest living writers, 'Wolf Hall' is that very rare thing: a truly great English novel, one that explores the intersection of individual psychology and wider politics. With a vast array of characters, and richly overflowing with incident, it peels back history to show us Tudor England as a half-made society, moulding itself with great passion, suffering and courage.

The story opens with\par|Meg Finn and Belch Brennan, two bad kids\par|on the block, breaking into a\par|pensioner's flat. At the very last\par|minute Meg reneges on the deal and tries\par|to break for freedom, leaving the aged\par|Lowrie McCall screaming with the pain\par|inflicted by Belch's bloodthirsty hound.\par|Backed into a corner by Belch and a\par|shotgun, Meg pleads with Belch to call\par|an ambulance and save the old man's\par|life. Instead he pulls the trigger and\par|in a split second of evil and madness\par|the bullet hits a gas tank and knocks\par|Meg's soul out of her skin, catapulting\par|her spirit along a vast tunnel on the\par|way to some particularly shiny, pearly\par|gates. \par| Meanwhile, Beelzebub is\par|fretting. His boss was expecting two\par|souls, and although Belch (in his new\par|incarnation as a dribbling, growling,\par|red-eyed dog-boy) took the correct turn\par|in the tunnel, he's rather miffed that\par|Meg found her way to the beautifully\par|buffed Pearlies and an interview with\par|Saint Peter and his rather complicated\par|points system. So, the archangel and the\par|demon do a deal, and Meg is given a\par|chance to redeem herself. If she fails\par|on her mission to help Lowrie McCall\par|work his way through his Wish List\par|before he dies, then she too will be\par|heading south to join the boy-band\par|members, the mime artists, Belch and the\par|world's computer boffins in fiery\par|damnation... \par| The Wish List was first\par|published in Ireland in 2000, bringing\par|with it much critical acclaim. In 2002,\par|following the enormous and well-deserved\par|success of the Artemis Fowl books, Eoin\par|Colfer's publishers decided to let the\par|rest of the world sneak a peak. And\par|about time too. Hopelessly hopeful,\par|immorally moral, rattling with the pain\par|of its anti-heroine as she faces her own\par|demons, and rib-crackingly,\par|laugh-out-loud funny, The Wish List\par|strikes an almost perfect balance\par|between good, old-fashioned scruples and\par|thoroughly modern irreverence in what is\par|ultimately, and most importantly, a darn\par|good read. Not for the faint-hearted,\par|and certainly not for those who can't\par|take a border-line sick joke every now\par|and then, The Wish List is a divinely\par|devilish tale for anyone who enjoys a\par|bucketful of grit and truck loads of\par|wisecracks with their reading material.\par|Ages 10 and over, recommended\par|particularly for older readers. --Susan\par|Harrison\par|}|

43	Under Milk Wood (BBC Radio Collection)	30	0563388609	ADULT	DRAMA	CD	001	1299	0	5		N	OGG	433						Read by Dylan Thomas|<blockquote>To begin at the beginning:|it is spring, moonless night in the|small town, starless and bible-black,|the cobble streets silent and the|hunched, courters'-and-rabbits' wood|limping invisible down to the sloe|black, slow, black, crow black fishing|boat-bobbing sea. [...] And all the|people of the lulled and dumbfounded|town are sleeping|now.</blockquote>|Subtitled "A Play for|Voices", Dylan Thomas's best known work,|Under Milk Wood, carries the double|legacy of the author's extensive work|for radio--a medium for which, like the|very different Samuel Beckett, he had an|almost intuitive grasp--and his skill|and ability as a poet. A polyphonic|evocation of a day in the life of an|imaginary small Welsh seaside town,|Thomas's play--"a green leaved sermon on|the innocence of men"--visits in turn|the inhabitants of Llareggub (read it|backwards for the joke) while they|sleep, when they wake and go about their|daily activities, as the night falls.|Balancing a rhythmic, densely poetic|language with a nuanced ear for the|musical cadences of speech, the play's|gentle, affectionate charm and humour|resonate to create a deeply textured|portrait of a community responding|almost mythically to the awakening of|spring.|The introduction to this new|edition details the book's slow genesis|and reveals a more serious aspect of|Thomas's creation--it was composed in|part as a response to the terrible|inheritance of World War II--in which|the affirmative, redemptive cast of the|play carries a moral dimension, an|imaginative, lyrical empathy for the|regenerative innocence of the average|human being and their capacity for|grace. Llareggub becomes a space in|which eccentricity is tolerated, sin is|forgiven and love is nurtured--or at|least dreamt about and possible. Thomas|has a democratic compassion for the|small dramas of the everyday and a|belief that what is commonplace unites|us, all underscored by the|transformative power of the language he|bestows on each inhabitant. His|characters--Captain Cat, Myfanwy Price,|Organ Morgan, Willy Nilly the Postman,|Polly Garter, Dai Bread, and|others--generously animated and blessed|by their author, have entered many|people's affection and literary memory.|In this light, it is easy to see why|Under Milk Wood has remained one of the|best-loved works of the 20th century and|one of the great plays for radio.|--Burhan Tufail

For J K Rowling the|pressure is certainly on to continue to|come up with thrilling, pacey storylines|that allow her hero to mature into a|young man without detracting from the|magical secret that has made Harry into|a superstar. In this book, the teenage|Harry has a certain gawky charm that|fits well with his advancing|adolescence. As the story moves on,|Harry too moves on to a new level of|maturity that leaves the reader|wondering how he will learn from his|experiences, and liking him all the more|as a character. | Once returned to|Hogwarts after his summer holiday with|the dreadful Dursleys and an|extraordinary outing to the Quidditch|World Cup, the 14-year-old Harry and his|fellow pupils are enraptured by the|promise of the Triwizard Tournament: an|ancient, ritualistic tournament that|brings Hogwarts together with two other|schools of wizardry--Durmstrang and|Beauxbatons--in heated competition. But|when Harry's name is pulled from the|Goblet of Fire, and he is chosen to|champion Hogwarts in the tournament, the|trouble really begins. Still reeling|from the effects of a terrifying|nightmare that has left him shaken, and|with the lightning-shaped scar on his|head throbbing with pain (a sure sign|that the evil Voldemort, Harry's sworn|enemy, is close), Harry becomes at once|the most popular boy in school. Yet,|despite his fame, he is totally|unprepared for the furore that follows.|| This is a hefty volume: 636 pages, of|which probably at least 200 could have|been cut without detracting from the|story. The weight and complexity of the|book is perhaps a hint that Rowling now|has her eye sharply focused on her adult|audience, and the average child-reader|(particularly one who is coming to Harry|Potter for the first time) may well find|its girth daunting. Rowling's ironic and|pointed observations on tabloid|journalism and the nature of media hype|is just one of the references littered|through the book that will tickle the|grown-ups but may well fly over the|heads of her young fans.|However, after|a slow start, Harry Potter and the|Goblet of Fire really starts to sparkle|halfway through with Rowling's familiar|magic (and yes, there is a death--sudden|and tragic--and yes, Harry does start to|notice girls). The crux of this story,|however, is Harry's gradual|coming-of-age and his handling of the|increasingly determined threats to his|own life.| This book is pivotal, not|just for the author for whom the heat is|well and truly on, but for Harry and his|readers who, by the last chapter, are|left in little doubt that there is much|more to come.

The Boleyn family is keen to rise through the ranks of society, and what better way to attract the attention of the most powerful in the land than to place their most beautiful young woman at court?

What happens next is common knowledge -- but here it is told in a way we've never heard it before, with all of Philippa Gregory's characteristic perceptiveness, backed by meticulous research and superb storytelling skills.

Bill Bryson was struck one day by the thought that we devote a lot more time to studying the battles and wars of history than to considering what history really consists of: centuries of people quietly going about their daily business - eating, sleeping and merely endeavouring to get more comfortable. And that most of the key discoveries for humankind can be found in the very fabric of the houses in which we live. This inspired him to start a journey around his own house, an old rectory in Norfolk, wandering from room to room considering how the ordinary things in life came to be. Along the way he did a prodigious amount of research on the history of anything and everything, from architecture to electricity, from food preservation to epidemics, from the spice trade to the Eiffel Tower, from crinolines to toilets; and on the brilliant, creative and often eccentric minds behind them. And he discovered that, although there may seem to be nothing as unremarkable as our domestic lives, there is a huge amount of history, interest and excitement - and even a little danger - lurking in the corners of every home.

A Short History of Nearly Everything is his quest to find out everything that has happened from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization - how we got from there, being nothing at all, to here, being us. Bill Bryson's challenge is to take subjects that normally bore the pants off most of us, like geology, chemistry and particle physics, and see if there isn't some way to render them comprehensible to people who have never thought they could be interested in science. It's not so much about what we know, as about how we know what we know. How do we know what is in the centre of the Earth, or what a black hole is, or where the continents were 600 million years ago? How did anyone ever figure these things out? On his travels through time and space, he encounters a splendid collection of astonishingly eccentric, competitive, obsessive and foolish scientists, like the painfully shy Henry Cavendish who worked out many conundrums like how much the Earth weighed, but never bothered to tell anybody about many of his findings. In the company of such extraordinary people, Bill Bryson takes us with him on the ultimate eye-opening journey, and reveals the world in a way most of us have never seen it before.

Over seven days, we follow the lives of seven major characters: a hedge fund manager trying to bring off the biggest trade of his career; a professional footballer recently arrived from Poland; a young lawyer with little work and too much time to speculate; a student who has been led astray by Islamist theory; a hack book-reviewer; a schoolboy hooked on skunk and reality TV; and, a Tube train driver whose Circle Line train joins these and countless other lives together in a daily loop. With daring skill, the novel pieces together the complex patterns and crossings of modern urban life. Greed, the dehumanising effects of the electronic age and the fragmentation of society are some of the themes dealt with in this savagely humorous book. The writing on the wall appears in letters ten feet high, but the characters refuse to see it - and party on as though tomorrow is a dream. Sebastian Faulks probes not only the self-deceptions of this intensely realised group of people, but their hopes and loves as well. As the novel moves to its gripping climax, they are forced, one by one, to confront the true nature of the world they inhabit.

A loathsome|creature--with blood-red skin, tattooed|eyes, four sets of teeth and a writhing|snake-mouth filled with purple-eyed,|armoured spiders--Dragwena has been|seeking her perfect partner for|centuries.

"I don't feel like I have lost a|wife but that I have gained a friend. I|would never have met Geoff if Marion|hadn't left me." MARION & GEOFF was one|of the most-loved and most-acclaimed BBC|comedies of recent years. Rob Brydon|wrote and starred as cuckolded Welsh|cabbie Keith Barret, recording a|hopelessly optimistic video diary about|his life as a divorcee. It was a|heartbreaking show; darkly comic and|brilliantly written. The series won Best|Drama at the South Bank Awards, and Rob|Brydon won a British Comedy Award for|his performance as Keith. Last summer|Brydon took his character Keith Barret|to the Edinburgh Festival with a show|(or rather a 'talk' or 'therapy|session') entitled MAKING DIVORCE WORK,|which drew on all of Keith's experience|as a divorcee. It was a sell-out, and|the Daily Telegraph declared it 'More|outright hilarious than the TV series'.|Now, with a new primetime BBC TV series|in the pipeline Keith Barret has settled|down and written an indispensable Self|Help guide to surviving relationship|break-ups.
107	The Six Wives of Henry VIII	53	0752861425	ADULT	HISTORY	CD	016	1699	2	5		N	NN	566						Read by Isla Blair|Divorced, beheaded, died; divorced,|beheaded, survived.' So the six wives of|Henry VIII - Catherine of Aragon, Anne|Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anna of Cleves,|Katherine Howard and Catherine Parr -|have become defined in a popular sense|not so much by their lives as by the way|these lives ended. In the same way their|characters are popularly portrayed as|female stereotypes: the Betrayed Wife,|the Temptress, the Good Woman, the Ugly|Sister, the Bad Girl and, finally, the|Mother Figure. But, as Antonia Fraser|brilliantly and conclusively proves,|they were rich and feisty characters.|They may have been victims of Henry's|obsession with a male heir, but they|were not willing victims. On the|contrary, they exhibited remarkable|degrees of spirit and defiance of which|women living now might still be proud.|They displayed considerable strength and|intelligence at a time when their sex|supposedly possessed little of either.|Antonia Fraser deals with each woman in|turn with sympathy - the sympathy they|deserve for having had the unenviable|fate of being Henry's wife. Inevitably|there was great rivalry between them, so|high were the stakes in the great game|of marrying the King of England. There|was jealousy too - the desperate|jealousy of Queens who found themselves|abandoned, but also the sexual jealousy|of the King who discovered himself|betrayed. The story Antonia Fraser tells|is romantic and cruel, funny and sad,|dramatic and enthralling. This is|historical biography at its best. "An|intoxicating mixture of sex, sentiment|and court intrigue...Fraser has the|knack...of making history not merely|readable but irresistible

The|running time is five hours 30 minutes|approximately.| Eoin Colfer's The Wish|List is a bitter yet rip-roaringly funny|tale of two wayward teenagers on the|road to hell--literally. The story opens|with Meg Finn and Belch Brennan, two bad|kids on the block, breaking into a|pensioner's flat. At the very last|minute Meg reneges on the deal and tries|to break for freedom, leaving the aged|Lowrie McCall screaming with the pain|inflicted by Belch's bloodthirsty hound.|Backed into a corner by Belch and a|shotgun, Meg pleads with Belch to call|an ambulance and save the old man's|life. Instead he pulls the trigger and|in a split second of evil and madness|the bullet hits a gas tank and knocks|Meg's soul out of her skin, catapulting|her spirit along a vast tunnel on the|way to some particularly shiny, pearly|gates. | Meanwhile, Beelzebub is|fretting. His boss was expecting two|souls, and although Belch (in his new|incarnation as a dribbling, growling,|red-eyed dog-boy) took the correct turn|in the tunnel, he's rather miffed that|Meg found her way to the beautifully|buffed Pearlies and an interview with|Saint Peter and his rather complicated|points system. So, the archangel and the|demon do a deal, and Meg is given a|chance to redeem herself. If she fails|on her mission to help Lowrie McCall|work his way through his Wish List|before he dies, then she too will be|heading south to join the boy-band|members, the mime artists, Belch and the|world's computer boffins in fiery|damnation... | The Wish List was first|published in Ireland in 2000, bringing|with it much critical acclaim. In 2002,|following the enormous and well-deserved|success of the Artemis Fowl books, Eoin|Colfer's publishers decided to let the|rest of the world sneak a peak. And|about time too. Hopelessly hopeful,|immorally moral, rattling with the pain|of its anti-heroine as she faces her own|demons, and rib-crackingly,|laugh-out-loud funny, The Wish List|strikes an almost perfect balance|between good, old-fashioned scruples and|thoroughly modern irreverence in what is|ultimately, and most importantly, a darn|good read. Not for the faint-hearted,|and certainly not for those who can't|take a border-line sick joke every now|and then, The Wish List is a divinely|devilish tale for anyone who enjoys a|bucketful of grit and truck loads of|wisecracks with their reading material.|Ages 10 and over, recommended|particularly for older readers. --Susan|Harrison

It's been|yet another infuriating and boring|summer with the despicable Dursleys,|this time with minimal contact from our|hero's non-Muggle friends from school.|Harry is feeling especially edgy at the|lack of news from the magic world,|wondering when the freshly revived evil|Lord Voldemort will strike. Returning to|Hogwarts will be a relief&#133; or will|it? |  Book five in JK Rowling's Harry|Potter series follows the darkest year|yet for our young wizard, who finds|himself knocked down a peg or three|after the events of last year. Over the|summer, gossip (usually traced back to|the magic world's newspaper, the Daily|Prophet) has turned Harry's tragic and|heroic encounter with Voldemort at the|Triwizard Tournament into an excuse to|ridicule and discount the teenager. Even|Professor Dumbledore, headmaster of the|school, has come under scrutiny from the|Ministry of Magic, which refuses to|officially acknowledge the terrifying|truth: that Voldemort is back. Enter a|particularly loathsome new character:|the toad-like and simpering ("hem, hem")|Dolores Umbridge, senior undersecretary|to the minister of Magic, who takes over|the vacant position of defence against|dark arts teacher--and in no time|manages to become the high inquisitor of|Hogwarts. Life isn't getting any easier|for Harry Potter. With an overwhelming|course load as the fifth years prepare|for their examinations, devastating|changes in the Gryffindor Quidditch team|line-up, vivid dreams about long|hallways and closed doors, and|increasing pain in his lightning-shaped|scar, Harry's resilience is sorely|tested. |  Harry Potter and the Order of|the Phoenix, more than any of the four|previous novels in the series, is a|coming-of-age story. Harry faces the|thorny transition into adulthood, when|adult heroes are revealed to be|fallible, and matters that seemed black|and white suddenly come out in shades of|gray. Gone is the wide-eyed innocent,|the whiz kid of <i>Harry Potter and the|Philosopher's Stone</i>. Here we have an|adolescent who's sometimes sullen, often|confused (especially about girls), and|always self-questioning. Confronting|death again, as well as a startling|prophecy, Harry ends his year at|Hogwarts exhausted and pensive. Readers,|on the other hand, will be energised as|they enter yet again the long waiting|period for the next title in the|marvellous magical series. --Emilie|Coulter

So begins one of Roald|Dahl's best books ever, and, ironically,|it is such a great story because the|premise is perfectly plausible from the|outset. When the narrator's parents die|in a car crash on page two (contrast|this terribly real demise with that of|James's parents who are devoured by an|escaped rhinoceros in James and the|Giant Peach), he is taken in by his|cigar-smoking Norwegian grandmother, who|has learned a storyteller's respect for|witches and is wise to their ways.|  The|bond between the boy and his grandmother|becomes the centrepiece of the tale--a|partnership of love and understanding|that survives even the boy's unfortunate|transformation into a mouse. And once|the two have teamed up to outwitch the|witches, the boy's declaration that he's|glad he's a mouse because he will now|live only as long as his grandmother is|far more poignant than eerie.|  Of|course, there's adventure here along|with Dahl's trademark cleverness and|sense of the grotesque. Dahl also|communicates some essential truths to|children: if they smoke cigars, they'll|never catch cold, and, most importantly,|they should never bathe, because a clean|child is far, far easier for a witch to|smell than a dirty one.

164	Carpe Jugulum	14	0552146536	ADULT	FANTASY	TAPE	008	1099	2	5		N	NN	366						Read by Tony Robinson|Carpe Jugulum is the 23rd Discworld|novel, and with it this  durable series|continues its juggernaut procession|onwards. Pratchett is an  author who|inspires such devotions that his fans|will fall on the novel with cries of |joy. Non-fans, perhaps, will want to|know what all the fuss is about; and|that's  something difficult to put into|a few words. The best thing to do for|those  completely new to Pratchett is to|sample him for themselves, and this|novel is as  good a place to start as|any. But fans have a more precise|question. They know  that Discworld|novels come in one of two varieties: the|quite good, and the  brilliant. So, for|instance, where Hogfather and Maskerade|were quite  good, Feet of Clay  and|Jingo were  brilliant. While true fans|wouldn't want to do without the former,|they absolutely  live for the latter.|And with Carpe Jugulum Pratchett has hit|jackpot again.  This novel is one of the|brilliant ones.  | The plot is a version|of an earlier Discworld novel, Lords and|Ladies, with the  predatory elves of|that novel being replaced here by suave|and deadly vampires,  and the tiny|kingdom of Lancre being defended by its|witches. But plot is the  least of|Pratchett's appeal, and Carpe Jugulum is|loaded with marvellous  characters (not|least the witches themselves, about whom|we learn a deal more  here), comic|touches and scenes of genius, and even|some of the renowned  down-to-earth|Pratchett wisdom (here about the inner|ethical conflicts we all  face, and the|wrongness of treating people as things).|Pratchett's vampires are  elegant Bela|Lugosi types, and they come up against|an unlikely but engaging  alliance of|witches, blue-skinned pixies like Rob|Roy Smurfs, a doubting priest  with a|boil on his face and a magical|house-sized Phoenix in a seamless, |completely absorbing and|feel-good-about-the-universe mixture.|Highly  recommended. --Adam Roberts

The Vampire's|Assistant is read gleefully and yet|touchingly by Alan Cumming. Darren is|now living with Mr Crepsley, and|struggling to be a "real" vampire, but|his squeamishness about drinking human|blood is becoming an obstacle to fully|embracing the lifestyle. As he is still|only half a vampire, and therefore|partly a normal teenage boy, his wants|and desires are hard to be satisfied by|the ageing Mr Crepsley. Meeting Evra the|snake boy when he and Mr Crepsley join|the Cirque du Freak ensures he has a|friend (however peculiar) his own age,|as does meeting the more ordinary Sam,|who is mesmerised by the Cirque du|Freak. | Alan Cumming reads the story|with sensitivity for Darren's loneliness|and new life and yet with some enjoyment|of the gruesomeness of drinking blood|and bizarreness of some of the|characters in the Cirque du Freak. The|tale may not make very peaceful bedtime|reading, but will definitely keep|children with a thirst for shivers and|sweats engrossed. The breaks in the|readings are sometimes laboured, so that|the next chapter feels anticlimactic,|but also are timed so that before you|realise it, you'll have listened to most|of the tale, always wanting to have your|suspicions of what happens next|confirmed. Darren's adventures, and|encounters with a variety of characters|(whether part of the Cirque du Freak or|not) are particularly enthralling with|Cumming's different voices, so that it|almost feels as if Mr Crepsley or Mr|Tiny are really in the room with you.|The ending explores from a very original|angle the importance of friendship and|such everyday themes as these ensure|that it seems likely that any number of|seemingly ordinary teenage boys could be|part-time vampires. --Olivia Dickinson
